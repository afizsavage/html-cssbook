        briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and
        guardian of sheep.</p>
        <h3>Breed History</h3>
        <p>
            The briard which is believed to have originated in France, has been breed for centuries
            to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, 
            messengers and to search for wounded soildiers because of its fine sense of hearing.
            Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently
            the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson 
            and Lafayette all owned briards.
